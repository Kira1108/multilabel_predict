# multilabel_predict
Multilabel Predictor is a sklearn wrapper, which implements one versus all method for multi-task machine learning problem.

Most of the machine learning prolems in real word are imbalanced classification problems.
Some resampling process is required before fitting the model
Multi-label prediction include methods that resample(over sampling or under sampling) before fitting the model.
Use Multi-bale evaluator to calculate metrics on each target.
